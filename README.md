## 🤖 VCMtalker AI Assistant

🧠 A standalone offline desktop AI agent for Windows with voice interaction, local LLM intelligence, long-term memory, smart file search, and system automation — distributed as a professional installer.

## 🏆 Overview

VCMtalker AI Assistant is a fully functional Windows desktop application that brings conversational AI directly to the user’s computer without relying on cloud APIs.

Powered by a local language model via Ollama, the assistant can understand natural language commands, perform system actions, remember information across sessions, search files, monitor system resources, and interact through both text and voice.

The application is packaged as a native Windows installer, allowing it to be installed and used like commercial software.

## ✨ Key Features

🧠 Natural Language Command Understanding

Interact using plain English instead of rigid commands.

Examples:

“Open calculator”

“Search Google for machine learning roadmap”

“Find file resume”

“What is CPU usage?”

🎤 Voice Interaction

Speech recognition via microphone

Text-to-speech responses

🟢 Always-Listening Mode

Continuous voice interaction without pressing buttons.

💾 Long-Term Memory
